# knight.js
A JavaScript implementation of Knight 2.0.1

See [the main page](https://github.com/knight-lang/knight-lang) for more details.

# Running
[node](https://nodejs.org/en) is required to run this, although deno could probably be used with some slight tweaks to `src/func.js`.

After installing node, just run `./knight`.

# Documentation
I don't have a super easy way to ensure that the documentation is 100% syntactically correct (I've just hovered over function/type names in VsCode and eyeballed it), so there might be some JSDoc semantic mistakes. However, the documentation should describe what each function does if you just read the text itself.
